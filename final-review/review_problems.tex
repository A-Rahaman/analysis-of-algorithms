\section{CLRS 26-3, Algorithmic Consluting}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Gore wants to open up an algorithmic consulting company.
    He has identified $n$ important subareas of algorithms which he represents
    by the set $A = \{ A_1, A_2,\dots A_n\}$ In each subarea $A_k$ he can hire
    an expert in that area for $c_k$ dollars. The consulting company has lined
    up a set $J = (J_1, J-2 \dots J_m)$ of potential jobs. In order to perform
    job $J_i$ the company needs to have hried experts in a subset $R_i \subseteq A$
    of subareas. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simulaneously. If the
    company chooses to accept job $J_i$, it must have hired eperts in all
  subares in $R_i$, and it will take in revenue of $p_I$ dollars.} 

  \textbf{Professor Gore's job is to determine which subareas to hire experts in and
    hwich jobs to accept in order to maimize the net revenue, which is the
    total income from jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the
  experts.}

  \textbf{Consider the following flow network $G$. It contains a source vertex $s$,
    vertices $A_1, A_2,\dots A_n$, vertices $J_1, J_2, \dots J_m$ and a sink
    vertex $t$. for $k = 1,2,\dots n,$ the flow network contains an edge
    $s<A_k$ with capacity $c(s,A_k) = c_k$,  and for $i = 1,2, \dots m$, the
    flow network contains an edge $(J_i, t)$ with capacity $c(J_i, t) = p_i$
    For $k = 1,2, \dots n$ and $i = 1,2, \dots m$ if $A_k \in R_i$ then $G$
  contains an edge $A_k, J_i)$ with capacity $c(A_k, J_i) = \infty$. }
\end{quote}

\subsection{ Show that if $J_i \in T$ for a finite-capacity cut $(S,T)$ of
$G$, then $A_k \in T$ for each $A_k \in R_i$.}
\newpage

\subsection{ Show how to determine the maxium net revenue from the capacity of
a minmum cut of $G$ and the given $p_i$ values.}
\vspace{8cm}


\subsection{ Give an efficient algorithm to determine which jobs to accept and
  which experts to hire. Analyze the running time of your algorithm in terms
  of $m,n,$ and $r = \sum_{i = 1}^m | R_i|$.}

  \section{34.5-2; 0-1 integer programming}
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Given an integer $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and an integer $m$-vector
    $b$, the \emph{0-1 integer-programming problem} asks whether there exists
    an integer $n$-vector $x$ with elements in the set $\{ 0, 1\}$ such that
    $Ax \leq b$. Prove that 0-1 integer programming is NP-Complete. (Hint:
  Reduce from 3-CNF-SAT)}

  \section{problem 1 from lect 23 erickson}
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Suppose you are given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, two vertices
      $s \text { and } t$, a capacity function $c:E \to \mathbf{R}^+$, and a second
      function $F:E \to \mathbb{R}$. Describe an algorithm to determine wether $f$ is a
    maximum $(s,t)$ flow in $G$.}

  \section{problem 5 from 24, erickson}
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{The Island of Sodor is home to a large number of towns and
      villiages, connected by an extensive rail network. Recently, several cases
      of a deadly contagious disease (either swine flu or zombies; reports are
      unclear) have been reported in the village of Ffarquhar. The controller of the
      Sodor railway plans to close down certain railway stations to prevent the
      disease from spreading to Tidmouth, his home town. No trains can pass through a
      closed station. To minimize expense (and public notice), he wants to close
      down as few stations as possible. However, he cannot close the Ffarquhar
      station, because that would expose him to the disease, and he cannot close the
    tidmouth station, because then he couldn't visit his favorite pub. }

    \textbf{ Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the minimum number of
      stations that must be closed to block all rail travel from Ffarquhar to
      Tidmouth. The Sodor rail network is represented by an undirected graph, with
      a vertex for each station and an edge for each rail connection between two
      stations. Two special vertices $f$ and $t$ represent the stations in
    Ffarquhar and Tidmouth.}

    \textbf{For example, given the following input graph (Figure
      \ref{fig:sodor}), your algorithm should return the number 2.}

\section{problem 8 from 24, erickson}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Suppose we are given an $n \times n$ square grid, some of whose
    squares are colored black and the rest white. Describe and analyze an
  algorithm to determine whether tokens can be placed on the grid so that }
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{every token is on a white square;}
    \item \textbf{every row of the grid contains exactly one token; and}
      \item \textbf{every column of the grid contains exactly one token}
    \end{itemize}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{erickson_2}
      
    \textbf{ Your input is a two-dimensional array 
      \textit{IsWhite}$[1 .. n, 1 .. n]$ of booleans, indicating which
      squares are white. Your output is a single boolean. For example, given
    the grid above as input, your algorithm should return TRUE. }

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Bonnie and Clyde have just robbed a bank. They have a bag onf money
    and want to divide it up. For each of the following scenarios, either give
    a polynomial-item algorithm, or prove that the problem is NP-Complete. The
    input in each case is a list of the $n$ items in the bag, along with the
  value of each.}

  \textbf{ Jared's note:For this problem, it may be helpful to use the fact that SUBSET-SUM
    is NP-Hard. See Section 34.5.5 for a defintion of SUBSET-SUM. (You only
    need to read the definition in this section, not the reduction that proves
    that SUBSET-SUM is NP-Hard.}

\subsection{The bag contains $n$ coins, but only 2 different denominations:
  some coins are worth $x$ dollars, and some are worth $y$ dollars. Bonnie and
Clyde wish to divide the money exactly evenly.}

\subsection{The bag contains $n$ coins, with an arbitrary number of diferent
  denominations, but each denomination is a nonnegative integer power of 2,
  ie.e, the possible denominations are 1 dollar, 2 dollars, 4, dollars, etc.
Bonnie and Clyde wish to divide the money exactly evenly.}

\subsection{The bag contains $n$ checks, which are, in an amazing coincidence,
  made out to ``Bonnie or Clyde.'' They wish to divide the checks to that they
each get the exact same amount of money.}

\subsection{The bag contains $n$ checks as in part (c), but this time bonnie
  and Clyde are willing to accept a split in which the difference is no larger
than 100 dollars.}

\section{Problem 34-4 from CLRS}
\begin{quote} 
  \textbf{Suppose that we have one machine and a set of $n$ tasks 
    $a_1, a_2, \dots a_n$, each of which requires time on the machine. Each
  task $a_j$ requires $t_j$ time units on the machine (its processing time),
yields a prfit of $p_j$, and has a deadline $d_j$. The machine can process only
one task at a time, and task $a_j$ must run without interrupotion for $t_j$
consecutive time units. If we complete task $a_j$ by its deadline $d_j$, we
receive a profit $p_j$ but if we complete it after its deadline, we receive no
profit. As an optimization problem, we are given the rpocessing times, profits,
and deadlines for a set of $n$ tasks, and we wish to find a schedule that
completes all the tasks and returns the greatest amount of profit. The
processing times, profits, and deadlines are all nonnegative numbers.}

\subsection{ State this problem as a decision problem.}

\subsection{Show that the decision problem is NP-Complete}

\subsection{Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem, assuming
  that all processing times are integers from 1 to $n$. (Hint: use dynamic
programming)}

\subsection{give a polynomial-time algoirthm for the optimization problem,
assuming that all processing times are integers from 1 to $n$.}
