\maketitle


\section{Cartels}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The Juarez Cartel is being investigated by the Federales. The $n$
  members of the cartel are organized in a pefect binary tree (recall that in a
perfect binary tree, all leaves are at the same depth and each internal node
has two children). Each day, the Federales select a node uniformly at random
from the tree. They then arrest this node and all nodes below it - subordinates
are arrested due to incriminating information obtained from the selected node.
All arrested nodes are removed from the tree. \\ what is the expected number of
days until all nodes are removed? Hint: for each node $v$ let $X_v$ be an IRV
that is 1 if $v$ is arrested before any of its ancestors fand 0 otherwise. Use
linearity of expectation. Your solution can use $\Theta$ notation. }
\end{quote}
Following the hint, if $X_v$ is our IRV, the probability of the IRV should be
\[ \frac{1}{log \ell +1} \] where $\ell = height of tree$. We can then see that
by linearity of expectation 
\[ \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{1}{log \ell +1} \] and instead of summing over the tree,
we can notice that we can sum at each level of the tree and bound it from above
by its height.

\[ \sum_{i=0}^{log n} \frac{2^i}{log n +1} \]
\[ \Theta(\frac{n}{log n}\] days until everyone is arrested. 



\section{Binary Search - Problem 17-2}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{
	Binary search of a sorted array takes logarithmic search time, but the time
	to insert a new element is linear in the size of the array. We can improve
	the time for insertion by keeping several sorted arrays.  Specifically,
	suppose that we wish to support SEARCH and INSERT on a set of n elements.
	Let $k =  \lceil lg(n+1)\rceil $ and let the binary representation of n be
	$ \langle n_{ k-1 }, n_{k-2},\dots n_0 \rangle$.  We have k sorted arrays $
	A_0, A_1, \dots A_{k-1}$ where for $ i = 0, 1, \dots k-1$, the length of
	array $A_i$  is $2^i$ .  Each array is either full or empty, depending on
	whether $n_i = 1 $ or $n_i = 0$, respectively. The total number of elements
	held in all k arrays is therefore $\sum_{i = 0}^{k -1 } n_i 2^i = n $ .
	Although each individual array is sorted, elements in different arrays bear
	no particular relationship to each other.}
\end{quote}


  \subsection{Describe how to perform the SEARCH operation for this data structure.
	Analyze its worst-case running time.}
	\subsubsection{answer}
	Searching the whole data structure involves searching each of the sorted
	arrays in the structure. If an element isn't found in an array, we have to
	search another array, and so on, so in the worst case we'd have to perform
	binary search on all of the $k = O(lg n) $ arrays in the structure. Binary search takes $O(lg n)$ time and this sums to $O(lg^2 n)$ time. 

%Search through the preliminary elements of $A_0, \dots, A_{\lg n - 1}$, finding $A_i[0] \leq x$; search $A_i$ for $x$: if $x$ is not
%  found, search the next $A_{i < j < \lg n}$ such that $A_j[0] \leq x$
%  or declare ``not found.''

%  Worst case, must search through all $A_0, \dots, A_{\lg n}$ arrays
%  in $\Theta(\lg n)$; each of which must be binary-searched in
%  $\Theta(\lg n)$ (since already sorted): for a total of $\Theta(\lg^2 n)$.

	\subsection{Describe how to perform the INSERT operation. Analyze its
	worst-case and amortized running times.  }
	\subsubsection{answer}

Insert an element as follows:
  Worst case merge and remerge arrays in $\Theta(2^{\lg n}) \in \Theta(n)$ time; alternatively, merge sorted lists in $\Theta(n)$:
  \begin{align}
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}2^i &= \left(\frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{2-1}\right)\\
    &\in \Theta(2^k)\\
    &\in \Theta(n)
  \end{align}
  Since, for every bit set, there are worst-case $\Theta(\lg n)$ merge
  operations; we can define modify the potential function in the
  counter example followingly:
  \begin{align}
    \Phi(D_i)-\Phi(D_{i-1}) &\leq \lg n\cdot(b_{i-1}-t_i+1) - \lg n\cdot b_{i-1}\\
    &= \lg n\cdot(t_i - 1)
  \end{align}
  And analyze the amortized complexity:
  \begin{align}
    \hat{c}_i &= c_i + \Phi(D_i) - \Phi(D_{i-1})\\
    &= \lg n \cdot t_i + \lg n\cdot(1 - t_i)\\
    &= \lg n
  \end{align}
  The amortized cost of each insert is therefore $\Theta(\lg n)$.






  \subsection{Discuss how to implement DELETE.}
  \subsubsection{answer}

For delete - find $A_j$, the first full array; and
  $A_i$, the array to which $x$ belongs. Remove an element $y$ from
  $A_j$ and replace $x$ in $A_i$ with it; distribute the remaining
  items from $A_j$ into $A_0, \dots, A_{j-1}$.

  Worst case analysis: $\Theta(\lg n)$ to find $A_j$; $\Theta(\lg^2 n)$ to find $A_i$; $\Theta(2^{\lg n}) \in \Theta(n)$ to insert $y$
  into $A_i$; and $\Theta(2^{\lg n - 1}) \in \Theta(n)$ to distribute
  $A_j$ to its underarrays: for $\Theta(n)$ total in the worst case.

\section{Problem 22-4 (Reachability)}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Let $G = (V,E) $ be a directed graph in which each vertex $ u \in V$
  is labeled with a unique integer $L(u) $ from the set $\{1,2,\dots,|V|\}$.
  For each vertex $u \in V$ let $R(u) = \{v \in V : u \rightsquigarrow v\}$ be the set
  of vertices that are reachable from $u$ Define $min(u)$ to be the vertex in
  $R(u)$ whose label is minimum, i.e., $min(u)$ is the vertex $v$ such that
  $L(v) = min\{L(w) : w \in R(u)\}. $ give an $O(V + E)$ time algorithm that
  computes min(u) for all vertices $u \in V$.  }
\end{quote}
\subsubsection{answer}
N
If we define the transpose of a directed graph $G = G^T$ such that the graphs
edges are reversed (e.g., the edge $(a,b)$ becomes $(b,a)$). Feed the graph to
the following algorithm:
\begin{lstlisting}

findMinReachable(graph g):
	g_transpose = g.transpose()
	for (vertex.discovered == False) in g_transpose:
		r(vertex) = l(vertex)
		vertex.setDiscovered(True)
		for u in dfs(vertex)
			if u.discovered ==  False:
			r(u) = r(vertex)
			u.setDiscovered(True)
	  
\end{lstlisting}
The algorithm is backed by DFS and only searches vertices once, keeping its
native $O(V + E) $ running time. 


\section{union by rank}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Curly conjectures that if we do union by rank,
\emph{without path compression}, the amortized cost of all operations
is $o(\log n)$.  Prove him wrong by showing that if we do union by
rank without path compression, there can be $m$ MAKESET, UNION and
FINDSET operations, $n$ of which are MAKESET operations, where the
total cost of all operations is $\theta(m \log n)$.}
\end{quote}



\section{articulation points}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Assume you are given a connected graph $G$.  Give an algorithm
that returns a vertex $v$ in $G$, such that if $v$ is removed, $G$ is
still connected.  Motivation: $G$ might represent a social network at
a company and you want to choose some unlucky person to fire whose
removal will not disconnect the company network.}
\end{quote}

Some definitions to show:
An articulation point is a point that when removed from a graph, disconnects
the graph. (See page 621 of CLRS).
$G_\pi = (V, E_\pi)$ is a DFS tree of $G$. 
The root of $G_\pi$ is an articulation point iff it has at least two children
in $G_\pi$. If this vertex is called $r$, if it has no children, then there are
no other nodes from which it can disconnect the graph and it is not an
articulation point. If $r$ has only one child, then every other point in
$G_\pi$ is reachable through the child node and $r$ is not an articulation
point. If the root has two children in $G_\pi$ then r is an articulation point.
If the root r has two children, $c_1, c_2$, and $c_1$ was visited first by the
DFS. If r is not an articulation point, then there must be another path between
nodes in $C_1, C_2$ that doesn't include $r$. Exploring $C_1$ would have revealed this
path and as such nodes of $C_2$ should be children of nodes in $C_1$. r is an
articulation point because they are in disconnected subtrees of r and no path
exists between them. 

$v$ is a nonroot vertex $v \in G_\pi$. v is an articulation point of $G$ iff v
has a child $c$ such that there is no back edge from $c$ or any decendent of
$c$ to an ancestor of v.


\section{Moe's graphs}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Moe conjectures that for any graph $G$, the set of
edges \{(u,v) : there exists a cut (S,V-S) such that (u,v) is a light
edge crossing (S, V-S)\} always forms a minimum spanning tree.  Given
a simple example of a connected graph that proves him wrong.}
\end{quote}
\subsubsection{Answer}
In the figure below, each edge has weight 1.
\begin{verbatim}
     a
    / \
   b---c
   \end{verbatim}

\section{ Exercise 23.1-2 (``Professor Sabatier conjectures'')}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem
  23.1. Let $G = (V E)$  be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w
defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning
tree for G, let $(S, V- S)$ be any cut of G that respects A, and let $u,v$ be a
safe edge for A crossing $(S, V-S)$. Then, $(u,v)$ is a light edge for the cut. Show
that the professor’s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.}
\end{quote}

A safe edge is defined to be any edge such that when we add it to a set of
edges $A$ we have a subset of a minimum spanning tree. There may be multiple
safe edges for a subset $S$ to vertices $V-S$ and not every safe edge must be
also be a light edge. 

\begin{verbatim}
    1     1
  a----b-----c
--|----|-----|-------C
  3    2     5
  |    |     |
  d	   e     f
\end{verbatim}

  only the edge $(b,e)$ is a light edge across the cut C but $(a,d)$ and
  $(c,f)$ are safe. 


\section{ Exercise 23.1-3 - MST} 
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Show that if an edge $(u,v)$ is contained in some minimum spanning
  tree, then it is a light edge crossing some cut of the graph.}
\end{quote}
\subsubsection{answer}
If we have a graph $G$ with MST $T$ having edge $a = (u,v) \in T$, removing $a$
from $T$ would bifurcate $T$ into sets $R,S$. Then $a$ crosses the cut and if
it wasn't a light edge for the cut we would have taken the edge with lighter
weight isntead of $a$ to get a tree with lighter total weight than $T$. This
would show that $T$ was in fact not an MST and as such, edge $a$ must be a
light cut for the cut partitioning the graph into $R,S$. 




\section{Wrestlers Exercise 22.2-6 / 22.2-7 } 
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{There are two types of professional wrestlers: ``babyfaces'' and
  ``heels''. Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not
be a rivalry. Suppose we have $n$ professional wrestlers and we have a list of
r pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an $O(n + r)$ time
algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the
wrestlers as babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rvailry is
between a babyface and a heel. Ifi t is posible to perform such a designation,
your algorithm should produce it.}
\end{quote}

This is equivalent to finding if a graph is bipartite. We can say that a graph
$G$ is bipartite if it can be partitioned into two sets $X,Y$ such that every
edge has one end point in $X$ and the other end point in $Y$. 
If we let graph $G = (V,E)$ be the graph with each vertex representing a
wrestler and each edge representing a rivalry between wrestlers such that for
$n$ wrestlers and $r$ rivalries, we have 
$V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots v_n\} = n = \{n_1, n_2, \dots n\} \text{and} E \{e_1, e_2, \dots e_r\} = \{r_1, r_2, \dots r \}$.  

We can 'color' the unlabled graph as follows to find if it is bipartite. Pick a
vertex v and label it as ``babyface''. Start a BFS on v. 

For each vertex whose distance from the source label is even, label it as a
``babyface'' and for each vertex whose distance from the source label is odd, label
it a ``heel''. If any child has the same label assignment as it's parent, we
have a non-bipartite graph and can return an answer as such, and if the
algorithm labels everything without returning a failed value, we have a
bipartite coloring of the graph with babyfaces and heels.
