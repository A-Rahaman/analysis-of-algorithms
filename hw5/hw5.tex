\section{Probability}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{ Solve Problem 5 on the midterm from 2013 at}
\end{quote}



\section{Binary Search - Problem 17-2}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{
	Binary search of a sorted array takes logarithmic search time, but the time
	to insert a new element is linear in the size of the array. We can improve
	the time for insertion by keeping several sorted arrays.  Specifically,
	suppose that we wish to support SEARCH and INSERT on a set of n elements.
	Let $k =  \lceil lg(n+1)\rceil $ and let the binary representation of n be
	$ \langle n_{ k-1 }, n_{k-2},\dots n_0 \rangle$.  We have k sorted arrays $
	A_0, A_1, \dots A_{k-1}$ where for $ i = 0, 1, \dots k-1$, the length of
	array $A_i$  is $2^i$ .  Each array is either full or empty, depending on
	whether $n_i = 1 $ or $n_i = 0$, respectively. The total number of elements
	held in all k arrays is therefore $\sum_{i = 0}^{k -1 } n_i 2^i = n $ .
	Although each individual array is sorted, elements in different arrays bear
	no particular relationship to each other.}
\end{quote}


  \subsection{Describe how to perform the SEARCH operation for this data structure.
	Analyze its worst-case running time.}

	\subsection{Describe how to perform the INSERT operation. Analyze its
	worst-case and amortized running times.  }
	\subsubsection{answer}






  \subsection{Discuss how to implement DELETE.}

\section{Problem 22-4 (Reachability)}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{ Let $G = (V,E) $ be a directed graph in which each vertex $ u \in V$
  is labeled with a unique integer $L(u) $ from the set $\{1,2,\dots,|V|\}$.
  For each vertex $u \in V$ let $R(u) = \{v \in V : u \rightsquigarrow v\}$ be the set
  of vertices that are reachable from $u$ Define min(u) to be the vertex in
  $R(u)$ whose label is minimum, i.e., min(us) is the vertex $v$ such that
  $L(v) = min\{L(w) : w \in R(u)\}. $ give an $O(V + E)$ time algorithm that
  computes min(u) for all vertices $u \in V$.
}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{answer}

\section{union by rank}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Curly conjectures that if we do union by rank,
\emph{without path compression}, the amortized cost of all operations
is $o(\log n)$.  Prove him wrong by showing that if we do union by
rank without path compression, there can be $m$ MAKESET, UNION and
FINDSET operations, $n$ of which are MAKESET operations, where the
total cost of all operations is $\theta(m \log n)$.}
\end{quote}


\section{graphs}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Assume you are given a connected graph $G$.  Give an algorithm
that returns a vertex $v$ in $G$, such that if $v$ is removed, $G$ is
still connected.  Motivation: $G$ might represent a social network at
a company and you want to choose some unlucky person to fire whose
removal will not disconnect the company network.}
\end{quote}


\section{Moe's graphs}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Moe conjectures that for any graph $G$, the set of
edges \{(u,v) : there exists a cut (S,V-S) such that (u,v) is a light
edge crossing (S, V-S)\} always forms a minimum spanning tree.  Given
a simple example of a connected graph that proves him wrong.}
\end{quote}

\section{ Exercise 23.1-2 (``Professor Sabatier conjectures'')}
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem
  23.1. Let $G = (V E)$  be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w
defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning
tree for G, let $(S, V- S)$ be any cut of G that respects A, and let $u,v$ be a
safe edge for A crossing $(S, V-S)$. Then, $(u,v)$ is a light edge for the cut. Show
that the professorâ€™s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.}
\end{quote}

\section{ Exercise 23.1-3 - MST} 
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Show that if an edge $(u,v)$ is contained in some minimum spannign
  tree, then it is a light edge crossing some cut of the graph.}
\end{quote}
\subsubsection{answer}

\section{Wrestlers Exercise 22.2-6 / 22.2-7 } 
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{There are two types of professional wrestlers: ``babyfaces'' and
  ``heels''. Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not
be a rivalry. Suppose we have $n$ professional wrestlers and we have a list of
r pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an $O(n + r)$ time
algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the
wrestlers as babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rvailry is
between a babyface and a heel. Ifi t is posible to perform such a designation,
your algorithm should produce it.}
