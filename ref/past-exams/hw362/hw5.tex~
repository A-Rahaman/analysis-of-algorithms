\begin{enumerate}

%sqr of graph
%\item Exercise 22.1-5 

%linear alg to determine if graph is bipartite
\item Exercise 22.2-6 (note: this type of graph is called bipartite)

%compute a path that traverses each edge in E exactly once in each direction
\item Exercise 22.2-8 (hint: Compute the BFS tree and think about how
you can handle the tree edges.  Now figure out how you can also handle
the edges that are not in the BFS tree)

%how can vertex u wind up in dfs tree itself even with incoming and
%outgoing edges
%\item Exercise 22.3-10

\item Exercise 24.1-1

\item Exercise 24.3-1

%\item Prove Claim 1 made about GenericSSSP in Lecture 20

\item Prove Claim 2 made about GenericSSSP in Lecture 20.  Let $l$ be
the number of edges in the path.  Your goal is to show that: ``For all
$l\geq 0$, if any path $s \leadsto v$ has $l$ edges then $dist(v) \leq
w(s \leadsto v)$ when the algorithm halts''.  Do this by induction on
$l$.  Show the base case (i.e. the goal holds when $l=0$).  Write down
the inductive hypothesis (i.e. for all $j<l$, \dots ) and then show
the inductive step.
%\item Exercise 24.3-2

\item Exercise 24.3-6 (hint: review the solutions from the last hw)
