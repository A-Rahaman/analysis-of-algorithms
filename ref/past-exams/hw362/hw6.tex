in half a page.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Exercise 25.2-1
\item Exercise 25.2-6
\item Exercise 34.5-1 (hint: to show the problem is NP-Hard, reduce
from the problem Clique discussed in lecture)
\item The problem \textbf{IndependentSet} asks: ``Does there exist a
set of $k$ vertices in a graph $G$ with no edges between them?''.
Show that this problem is NP-Complete. (hint: to show the problem is
NP-Hard, again reduce from Clique)
\item Extra Credit: Problem 25-1
%\item Extra Credit: Exercise 25.2-7
\item Extra Credit: Exercise 34.1-5
\item Extra Credit: Problem 34-3
